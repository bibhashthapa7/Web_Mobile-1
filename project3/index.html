                <h3>Mountains:</h3>
                <p>
                    Mount Everest is the most well-known mountain in Nepal due to its status as the 
                    world's tallest peak. However, Nepal has many additional mountains. The mountains of Nepal beckon 
                    superlatives, from the tallest to the most popular to the most remote. Nepal, which is located on the 
                    souther slopes of the 
                    Himalayas, is home to eight of the world's ten highest peaks. These peaks include Mount 
                    Everest (8,848m; on the border between Nepal and Tibet) which is also the tallest mountain 
                    of the world, Lhotse (8,516 m), Makalu (8,463 m), and Kanchenjunga (8,586 m).
                        
                </p>

            <div class = "right">
                <h3>Rivers:</h3>
                <p>
                    Nepal is well-known for being the source of the Ganges River. Many of the Ganges' 
                    major tributaries originate in Nepal. The Ganges has four feeder rivers: the 
                    Kankai, Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki. The first group of rivers 
                    include the country's three main river systems, the Koshi, Gandaki, and Karnali, all of which originate in glaciers and snow-fed lakes. 
                    Rivers in the second group include the Mechi, Mahakali, Bagmati, Kamala, Rapti, 
                    and others, the majority of which originate in the Mahabharat range.

                    <h3>Cities:</h3>
                    <p>
                         Nepal has numerous large cities, which contribute to the country's 
                        overall population of approximately 31 million people. Kathmandu is by far the 
                        largest city in Nepal. It is not only the largest city in Nepal, with a population 
                        of 1.4 million, but it is also the only city in Nepal with a population that has 
                        reached the 1,000,000 mark. Pokhara, the next largest city, with a population of 
                        only 200,000 people, a far cry from the figures stated in Nepal. There are five 
                        additional cities with populations greater than 100,000. There are also other smaller 
                        cities with large populations, with populations exceeding 10,000 people each city.

                    <h3>Temples:</h3>
                        <p>
                            Nepal has a plethora of religious architectural wonders due to its ideal 
                            combination of Hinduism and Buddhism. The temples in Nepal are a must-see 
                            while visiting the nation, with some having a deep connection to the Ramayana 
                            and others just stunning in their grandeur. The Swayambhunath Stupa, Boudhanath 
                            Stupa, Changunarayan Temple, Budhanilkantha, Dakshinkali, Pashupatinath, 
                            and Manakamana are some religious sites one must not miss while visiting the country.

                    governmental and cultural center. Kathmandu is a city where old traditions coexist 
                    with cutting-edge technology. The grandeur of the past, on the other hand, enchants 
                    the visitor, who may linger on an elegantly carved wooden window frame, an 18th 
                    century bronze sculpture, or a spiritually uplifting temple or stupa.</span>

                        stunning sculptures. With its tiny lanes, brick residences, and a plethora of well-preserved
                         Hindu temples, Buddhist monasteries (vihars), and monuments, the city preserves much of

                            east of Kathmandu on the Arniko Highway. Bhaktapur, 
                             has managed to maintain its unique ambience with brick-paved roads, attractive red brick homes, and a way of life 
                            that dates back to medieval times. This historic city is particularly well-known 
                            for its ceramics and woodcarving, which are prominently displayed on the squares 
                            and windows of local buildings and temples.</span>

                        with the new is an experience in and of itself, and one you won't want to miss. 
                        Kirtipur is a vibrant town that conducts a variety of traditional festivals called 
                        as Jatras in Nepali, which visitors may attend. Indrayani Jatra, held in November 
                        and December, and Bagh Bhairab Jatra, held in August, are the most well-known Jatras.</span>
