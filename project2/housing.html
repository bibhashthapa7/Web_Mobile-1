                <h2>Impact on: Housing</h2>
                <p> The combination of increased demand and limited supply has resulted in an unprecedented 
                    rise in house prices. The median listing price increased by 18.7 percent year over year, 
                    marking 35 consecutive weeks of double-digit price rise, and the total number of 
                    properties actively listed for sale remains less than half of what it was before the 
                    recession.

                The Household Pulse figures also reveal that millions of people are behind on their rent or 
                mortgage payments. According to statistics collected September 15-27, an estimated 10.3 
                million individuals living in a rental property — 14 percent of adult renters — were behind 
                on their rent. Some of these households were already behind on their payments before the 
                pandemic, while many others faced economic shocks such as job loss, reduced hours, or the 
                death of a family member. The majority of the overdue loans, representing 2.1 million 
                borrowers, were more than three months past due, indicating significant economic difficulty. 
                Furthermore, more than one in four renters with incomes under $25,000 reported that they were 
                behind on their rent.
