                <h2>Impact on: Unemployment</h2>
                <p> As a result of the pandemic, there was an acute and unprecedented collapse in employment 
                    which exceeded that of any recession in the last 150 years. From the end of March to 
                    the end of July, a total of 52.7 million individuals filed for unemployment insurance 
                    benefits, breaking the previous record. Although new applications for unemployment 
                    benefits have declined since pandemic-related lockdowns prompted a rise in claims 
                    at the end of March, weekly jobless claims remained close to 1.5 million at the end 
                    of the third week of July. Unemployment claims dropped out in June and the first two 
                    weeks of July, indicating that new layoffs were being countered primarily by firms 
                    hiring and returning personnel as states reopened their economies.

                <p> National employment losses peaked in April of 2020 when the country and every state 
                    had lost more jobs since February of that year than during the Great Recession. Overall, 
                    the economy has regained 76 percent of those jobs, albeit this figure masks significant 
                    variance by state. Idaho and Utah are the only states that have regained 100% of their 
                    jobs. Arizona has regained 97 percent of its lost employment, while Montana has restored 
                    90 percent. Others have suffered worse. Wyoming has recovered just 38%, Hawaii and Alaska 
                    have regained 44%, while Louisiana has recovered 49%. However, there were 5.3 million 
                    fewer jobs in August 2021 than there were in February 2020.
