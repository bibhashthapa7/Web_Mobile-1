                <h2>Impact on: Industries</h2>
                <p> The pandemic hit different industries differently and they have recovered at 
                    different paces. The Leisure and Hospitality sector has been affected the most from 
                    the beginning of the pandemic. Within that sector nationally, the Accommodation and 
                    Food Services industry has recovered 81% of its jobs and the Arts, Entertainment and 
                    Recreation industry 72%. Despite these recoveries, the biggest industrial gap remains 
                    in Accommodation and Food Services. It is down 1.3 million jobs, or 9.2 percent, from 
                    its peak in February 2020. New York is still losing 26 percent of its employment in this
                     category, the worst in the US, with Hawaii, Alaska, and Nevada trailing with 23 percent 
                     job losses. Jobs in this field are up 1.3 percent in Idaho, with deficits of less than 
                     5% in Oklahoma, Montana, and Utah. Nationally, the Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation 
                     business is still down from 376,000 jobs, which is 15% lower than pre-COVID levels.

                <p> The Health Care and Social Assistance sector accounts for a significant amount of the 
                    employment gaps in most states, and while 68 percent of the jobs lost nationally have 
                    returned, payroll employment is still down 746,000 positions. Shortfalls in this sector's 
                    sub-categories have varied widely and, as of August 2021, are largely in Nursing and 
                    Residential Care Facilities and Social Assistance. Child Day Care, which is included in 
                    Social Assistance, has seen a 12% decrease in employment nationally. Nationally, two 
                    private-sector industries—Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services and Finance 
                    and Insurance—have returned to pre-COVID employment levels.
