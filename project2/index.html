            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> The world and US economy have been thrown into disarray as a result of the coronavirus 
                illness (COVID-19) pandemic, which has claimed a significant human toll and shut down 
                important economic sectors. The economic consequences of COVID-19 have been significant 
                for the country and every state. The amount of jobs lost and the drop in economic production 
                has been disastrous, and many individuals are financially harmed, in many cases severely. 
                However, due to significant governmental action, the amount of human deprivation was far lower 
                than it would have been. Every state is recovering economically from the pandemic-induced fall 
                in employment that occurred in 2020 when the country lost almost 22 million jobs between February 
                and April. As of the August 2021 Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) monthly payroll employment survey, 
                the nation has regained more than three-quarters of those jobs. Individual states have recovered from
                 a range of 38 percent to all of their lost employment. Many of the underperforming states, on the 
                 other hand, are expected to catch up by 2022.
